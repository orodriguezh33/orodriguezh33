# Oscar Rodriguez

Finance guy learning data engineering by building stuff.

## What I do

I'm transitioning from finance into data engineering. Instead of just analyzing data, I'm learning to build the systems that make data reliable.

Currently focused on:
- ETL pipelines (Python + SQL)
- Data warehousing (Bronze/Silver/Gold layers)
- Docker for reproducible environments
- Building stuff that actually runs, not just tutorials

## Projects

### SQL Data Warehouse ETL
End-to-end pipeline with automated validation and Docker setup.  
Built from a SQL tutorial, extended with Python orchestration.

**BI:** Power BI (DAX, Power Query)  
**Tools:** Docker, Git, VS Code

## Background

- Business Administration + Master's in Finance
